# Super Apps for School and University

## Attendance, Payment, Parental Control

This project is an integrated information system designed to streamline attendance tracking, administrative processes, and reporting for vocational high schools. The system enhances efficiency by digitizing school operations, reducing manual work, and improving data accuracy.

The application consists of two main components:

1. Back-office platform – A web-based system for school administrators to manage attendance records, administrative tasks, and generate reports.
2. Android application – A mobile app for students to track their attendance, receive updates, and access relevant school information.

In this project, I played a key role as a full-stack developer, responsible for both web and mobile development. My tasks included designing the system architecture, implementing backend services, developing user-friendly interfaces, and ensuring smooth integration between the web platform and the mobile app.

## Payment System

This project is a web-based system designed to simplify student payment processes and administrative tracking. It provides an efficient and transparent solution for managing tuition fees and other financial transactions within universities.

The system integrates with Bank BNI, allowing students to make payments seamlessly using virtual accounts. This ensures automated reconciliation, reducing manual errors and improving financial management for both students and administrators.

As a full-stack developer, I was responsible for designing and developing the entire system, including backend services, frontend interfaces, and third-party integrations with banking services.

## Mini Bank

This project is a savings system designed to educate students on financial management. It provides a structured way for students to save money while learning essential financial literacy skills.

The system consists of two main components:

1. Web-based back-office – A platform for administrators to manage student savings, track transactions, and generate reports.
2. Android application – A mobile app for students to monitor their savings, set financial goals, and receive educational insights on money management.

As a full-stack web and mobile developer, I was responsible for designing and implementing the entire system, ensuring seamless integration between the web platform and the Android app to provide a smooth user experience.
